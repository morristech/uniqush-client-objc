Introduction
====================
This is an implementation of uniqush-conn client in Objective C. It's currently compiled for iOS only, but it should be straight forward to set it up for OSX.

Build
====================
You'll need to grab two submodules:
```bash
# git clone git@github.com:uniqush/uniqush-client-objc.git
# cd uniqush-client-objc
# git submodule init
# git submodule update
```
Then open up uniqush-client.xcworkspace.

How To Use
====================
It is currently still under development, but you can look at UQEarlyBird sample app for a quick look how it works. You must have [uniqush-conn](uniqush/uniqush-conn) set up first.
